# Install a PINNED, checksum-verified shellcheck.
#
#   usage: scripts/install-shellcheck.sh <install-dir> [version]
#
# The ONE installer for shellcheck in this repo. `make install-tools` calls it
# and the Gitea CI lint job runs the same script, so the shellcheck that backs
# actionlint's SC* rules on a developer's machine and the one in CI are the same
# binary and cannot drift.
#
# WHY shellcheck HAS TO BE INSTALLED AT ALL
# -----------------------------------------
# actionlint delegates every SC-prefixed rule to shellcheck. With shellcheck NOT
# on PATH it DISABLES those rules and still EXITS 0 at default verbosity — only
# `actionlint -verbose` prints "Rule shellcheck was disabled". So `make lint`
# and the CI lint job were a paper gate for shell findings on a box that lacks
# the tool; that is what let a real SC2046 reach main (fixed in #21). The lint
# target now asserts this binary is present, but an assertion with no way to
# satisfy it is just a red an agent cannot clear — hence this installer lands
# with it.
#
# WHY NOT `apt-get install shellcheck` OR `curl ... | sh`
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The distro package floats to whatever the archive ships (version drift between
# CI and a dev box is exactly what the SC gate cannot tolerate), and piping a
# fetched script into a shell runs unread, unverified code as the build user.
# This downloads the PINNED release artifact and checks its bytes before
# anything is executed. Nothing from the download is ever run as a script.
#
# HOW THIS PINS, AND WHY IT IS STRONGER THAN scripts/install-trivy.sh
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Upstream (koalaman/shellcheck) publishes NO checksums file next to its release
# artifacts, so — unlike install-trivy.sh, which fetches trivy's published
# checksums from the same origin as the tarball — the expected SHA-256 is PINNED
# HERE, in the repo, under code review. That is the property install-trivy.sh
# documents it does NOT have: a hash committed to the tree is not fetched from
# the same place as the bytes it guards, so a compromised release that rewrites
# the artifact cannot also rewrite the expectation without a reviewed commit to
# this file. The cost is that bumping the version REQUIRES updating the pinned
# hash below in the same commit; a version with no embedded checksum is refused
# rather than downloaded on trust.
#
# To bump shellcheck: change PINNED_VERSION, add the new artifacts' SHA-256 to
# the checksum table, run this, and re-run `make lint`.
