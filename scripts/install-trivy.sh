# install-trivy-template: v1 — install a PINNED, checksum-verified trivy.
# Source of truth: software/templates/github-actions/install-trivy.sh in the
# automatethethings repo. Copy to <repo>/scripts/install-trivy.sh (chmod +x),
# together with .trivy-version at the repo root — the script refuses to run
# without a version, and nightly.yml reads the same file for the trivy-action
# `version:` input.
#
#   usage: scripts/install-trivy.sh <install-dir> [version]
#
# The ONE installer for trivy in a repo. Both `make install-tools` and the
# Gitea path of .github/workflows/nightly.yml call it, so the scanner on a
# developer's machine and the scanner in CI are the same binary — and neither
# can drift from the other by editing one of them.
#
# WHY NOT `curl .../install.sh | sh`
# ---------------------------------
# That is what this replaces, in both call sites. It fetched a script from a
# MUTABLE ref (contrib/install.sh on `main`) and executed it, unread and
# unverified, as the build user. Anyone who could change that file — upstream
# compromise, account takeover, a MITM on the fetch — would get arbitrary code
# execution on the runner, and in nightly.yml that runner holds a token with
# security-events: write. Pulling the security scanner itself through an
# unverified channel inverts the point of running it.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARANTEES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# ------------------------------------------
# Guarantees: the version is fixed (no silent upgrade to whatever shipped
# today), the bytes are checked against the release's published SHA-256 before
# anything is executed, and nothing from the download is ever run as a script.
# A corrupted or tampered-in-transit tarball is refused.
#
# Does NOT guarantee: the checksums file is fetched from the same origin as the
# tarball, so this is not a signature check and does not defend against a
# compromised release where an attacker rewrites both. Upstream publishes a
# sigstore bundle next to each artifact (trivy_<ver>_checksums.txt.sigstore.json);
# verifying that with cosign is the next hardening step and needs cosign on the
# runners first. Stated here rather than implied, so nobody reads "verified" as
# more than it is.
#
# To bump trivy: edit .trivy-version, run this, and re-run `make security`. The
# same file feeds the trivy-action `version:` input in nightly.yml, so the
# GitHub and Gitea paths move together.
